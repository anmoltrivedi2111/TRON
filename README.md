# TRON
Tron is a voice-controlled desktop AI assistant built with Python and PyQt5. It features a custom animated UI and responds to spoken commands only—no typing needed. Powered by the Cohere API for conversations and the Grok API for real-time internet data, Tron can open apps, generate documents, fetch live info, and more—all hands-free.
