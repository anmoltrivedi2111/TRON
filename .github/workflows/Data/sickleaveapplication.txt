Dear [Recipient's Name],

I am writing to formally request sick leave from [Start Date] to [End Date] due to [briefly describe your illness, e.g., severe headache and fever].

I have been experiencing [mention symptoms if necessary] and have consulted a doctor. The doctor has advised me to take complete rest for the next few days to recover fully. I have attached a copy of the medical certificate for your reference.

During my absence, I will ensure that all my tasks and responsibilities are covered as much as possible. I will also be available via email or phone for any urgent matters, if necessary. I will also make sure to update my colleagues on my progress and ensure a smooth handover of my duties.

I appreciate your understanding and support during this time. I will make sure to catch up on any missed work as soon as I am able to return. Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
[Your Position]
[Your Contact Information]
